# 🔐 Innovative Door Lock System Design

This repository documents the **design process, user research, and evaluation** behind a smart and innovative door lock system tailored for real-world usability and enhanced security.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an intuitive and secure door lock system that addresses common user pain points such as forgotten keys, accessibility issues, and a lack of adaptability to user habits. Through multiple design iterations and continuous feedback, the system evolves into a user-centered solution.

## 🧩 Key Features

- Touchless or code-based locking/unlocking
- Easy installation for users of all skill levels
- Designed with both aesthetics and security in mind
- Informed by real user needs, surveys, and interviews
