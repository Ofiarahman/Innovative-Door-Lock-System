**Automated Key Management in Residential Buildings**

In most Finnish apartment buildings, access and entry to saunas, laundry rooms, and main entrances are granted with one physical key. At many of the buildings, there are gates equipped with hydraulic closing systems, but the opening is password controlled. However, there are several issues concerning efficiency in the usage of the key system. For example, tenants always must bear the burden of carrying keys and risk losing them, sometimes bringing in a heavy penalty and even the need to replace locks. Getting keys from the housing company's office is also not very convenient, and some gate codes do not work after 8 pm and occasionally do not work at all, which is frustrating. Furthermore, it is also difficult to open the locks using a physical key or even password protected system when our hands are occupied with grocery bags or other things. While there is an app to book laundry and sauna times, keys are still physically required to access such facilities.

**Proposed Solution using Face Recognition**

The solution model proposes a face recognition system to handle such problems. Camera sensors are mounted at various main points around the building-at the main door, outside the apartments, and in the vicinity of all the common facilities like the laundry and sauna rooms. Tenants would have to register their face once on a central housing app and would create a unique digital code backup in case the recognition fails. This will enable smooth entry without the use of physical keys, integrated with a booking app in order to facilitate entry and increase convenience, security, and reliability for all tenants.
