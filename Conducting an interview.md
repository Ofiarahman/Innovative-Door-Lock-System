# Description of the Problem

In most Finnish apartment buildings, access to apartments, shared
facilities like saunas and laundry rooms, and main entrances requires a physical key. Some gates use
password-protected systems with hydraulic closers, but these systems come with usability issues.
Tenants face challenges such as the burden of carrying keys, fear of losing them which result in costly
replacements, inconvenient collection processes from the housing company, and occasional failure of
gate codes, especially after 8 pm. Additionally, when hands are occupied with groceries, opening
physical or password locks becomes difficult. Although an app exists for booking facilities of sauna
and laundry, it does not eliminate the need for keys. This report explores these issues with references,
later parts are more about preparing interview questions and conducting interviews. Finally, the
technique of the presentation of the problem is discussed in the last part.

# References of the Problem

Concepts from Norman's The Design of Everyday Things indicate
that good design minimises frustrations for the users by making systems intuitive and reliable. Yet, the
existing system of door locks in the housing completely violates these principles by requiring tenants
to remember gate codes, manually unlock doors when hands are occupied, and deal with access issues
after hours.

The ABCS framework of Ritter further guided the analysis of these issues by focusing on finding prospects for a more efficient, user-centred solution which involves analysing:
- **Anthropometry** (physical ease of use)
- **Behaviour** (adaptation to workflows)
- **Cognition** (lowering cognitive load)
- **Social elements** (team or communal dynamics)

Research also drew on the findings of two articles:
1. **Ha, I. (2015):** The article also identifies development in
IoT-based digital door lock systems and development that has the ability to enhance security and
usability through features such as remote control, user proximity recognition, and automatic
operation. These solutions address a few problems, including user inconvenience and lock tampering,
which applies to the problem at hand concerning the problem I stated for the project.
2. **Pinjala & Gupta, 2019:** Another research from which I was inspired discussed a smart lock system that integrates IoT with real-time control over a smartphone application. Utilising a camera and Raspberry Pi, the system
provides remote monitoring, verification, and operation of doors. This would alleviate one from the
use of physical keys that can either be stolen or lost and further add to convenience by allowing
real-time control of who is visiting.

Most importantly, I chose this problem to find a solution as I myself am a sufferer with the password
lock system of my building, also I talked with several tenants from my social circle who fear losing
their keys and pay the high cost of making new keys.

# Main Questions About the Problem

- **Why do tenants find physical key systems inconvenient?**  
  *Reason:* This question maps to understanding specific pain points, such as when carrying keys, misplacing them, or failing the code at a gate.

- **How often do gate codes fail or become unreachable?**  
  *Reason:* To characterise frustrations and potential user dissatisfaction frequency.

- **What kind of security does the existing key system have?**  
  *Reason:* To assess whether current solutions adequately address tenant concerns about unauthorised access.

- **How do tenants perceive the existing apps for facility booking?**  
  *Reason:* To assess familiarity with digital systems and potential resistance to technological upgrades.

- **What are the penalties related to lost keys or lock replacement?**  
  *Reason:* To quantify the financial pain involved, assisting in driving acceptance of a new solution.

# Follow-up Questions

- **What features would tenants prioritise in a new access system?**  
  *Reason:* To tailor the proposed solution to meet user needs effectively.

- **Do you think this could be solved with a digital or biometric system? Why or why not?**  
  *Reason:* To evaluate participants' openness to new solutions and perceived effectiveness.

- **What are your concerns or barriers that might inhibit you from adopting a new access system?**  
  *Reason:* To understand potential resistance to change.

- **Would tenants prefer multiple services (like access and booking) to be integrated into one app?**  
  *Reason:* To determine if simplifying the digital experience would enhance user satisfaction.

- **Would the tenant trust the housing company to securely manage biometric data?**  
  *Reason:* To assess confidence in data privacy and point towards a clear policy need on data protection and transparency.

# Interview

I conducted an interview to like me if tenants are having the same problem with the locking system here you have to carry your keys wherever you go, so I took the interview of a friend who is also a tenant and know about the situations.

# Transcript of the Interview

**Interviewer:** Okay, so I will be asking you a few questions about my project as I explained to you earlier. First, I will ask some main questions, and then there will be some follow-up questions. Are you ready?  
**Participant:** Yeah, sure. You can go ahead.  

**Interviewer:** The first question is, why do tenants find physical key systems inconvenient? What do you think?  
**Participant:** That’s a great question. The hassle of carrying keys everywhere is annoying and inconvenient. For example, once I lost my keys and had to pay around €300 for a replacement. Another time, I had to collect my keys from the housing office, but it clashed with my university lecture, which I couldn’t attend.  

**Interviewer:** Yeah, that inconvenience is common for many people. So, the second question is: how often do gate codes fail or become unreachable? You know we have gate codes at the main entrance of our buildings. How often do the gate codes fail?  
**Participant:** That’s an important question. Gate codes sometimes don’t work. For example, they often fail to operate after 8 pm, which is really frustrating when you come home late. Occasionally, the system fails unexpectedly as well.

**Interviewer:** That’s true. So, the third question is: what kind of security does the existing key system
have? What do you think?
**Participant:** In my opinion, the current system uses physical keys and password-protected gates.
While they are in place, lost keys are a big security risk. If someone finds your keys, they can easily
access your building and even your apartment.

**Interviewer:** Yes, that’s a major issue. So, how do tenants perceive the existing apps for facility
booking, like those for laundry or sauna reservations?
**Participant:** The apps are great for booking laundry and sauna slots. However, we still need physical
keys to access the facilities, which, in my opinion, defeats the purpose of having a digital system.

**Interviewer:** Exactly, the key dependency is a big factor. So, the fifth question is: what are the
penalties related to lost keys or lock replacements?
**Participant:** Like I mentioned earlier, I had to pay around €300 for losing my keys. In some cases, the
locks for the entire unit need to be replaced, which is very inconvenient and costly.

**Interviewer:** That’s true; it’s a big inconvenience. Now, let’s move to some follow-up questions. My
sixth question is: what features would tenants prioritise in a new access system?
**Participant:** Tenants would prioritise convenience, like hands-free access. A system that offers
simplicity and reliability would be very important.

**Interviewer:** Yeah, I think that would make things much easier for tenants. Here’s the seventh
question: do you think this could be solved with a digital or biometric system? Why or why not?
**Participant:** Yes, a digital or biometric system could definitely solve many of these issues. It would
eliminate the need to carry keys or remember gate codes, which is very convenient. However,
reliability is mainly if the system fails often or doesn’t recognize tenants correctly, it could become
frustrating.

**Interviewer:** That’s true. So, what are your concerns or barriers that might inhibit you from adopting
a new access system? For example, if I introduced a new system, what barriers might you face?
**Participant:** Privacy would be a big concern. I’d need reassurance that my biometric data is stored
securely and wouldn’t be shared with anyone. Another concern is whether the system would work
consistently, especially in bad weather or other challenging conditions.

**Interviewer:** Yes, that’s an important point. My next question is: would tenants prefer multiple
services to be integrated into one app? For example, an app where you could book laundry or sauna
slots and also unlock doors.
**Participant:** Yes, having everything integrated into one platform would be great. It would be much
more convenient than using separate systems for booking and access.

**Interviewer:** I agree, that would simplify things. My last question is: would tenants trust the housing
company to securely manage biometric data?
**Participant:** I think trust depends on transparency. If the housing company provides clear information
about data handling and privacy measures, tenants are likely to trust them.

**Interviewer:** Thank you so much for participating in this interview!
**Participant:** Thank you for having me. It was a pleasure.

# Presentation of the Problem

**Technique Used:** Concrete Scenario  

**Scenario:** Imagine a tenant returning home with hands full of grocery bags. At the main gate, the gate code doesn't work after 8 pm. The tenant, being very upset, balances bags to retrieve their key. Later, they head to the laundry room but have to use the same key again, even though they booked the time through an app. The loss of this key would imply paying €300 and visiting the housing company to replace it.

**Reason for Choosing This Technique:**  
Scenarios illustrate the daily frustrations of tenants, showing that the problem is relevant and situated in a context of reality. It captures the pain points of users and justifies the need for an intuitive keyless system.
